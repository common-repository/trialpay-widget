TrialPay is a company that matches consumers with offers from name-brand companies like Vonage,
TiVo, BlockBuster, Discover, American Express, Geico, and the Wall Street Journal.  Those companies

Some offers pay just a few dollars, some pay close to $50.  It varies by company, offer, and region.
We use TrialPay as an alternative payment for our popular shareware utility, and 
the TrialPay payments average about $15.
